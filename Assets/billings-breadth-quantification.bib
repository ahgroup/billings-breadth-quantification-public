  abstract = {Each person has a unique immune history to past influenza virus infections. Exposure to influenza viruses early in life establishes memory B cell populations that influence future immune responses to influenza vaccination. Current influenza vaccines elicit antibodies that are typically strain specific and do not offer broad protection against antigenically drifted influenza strains in all age groups of people. This is particularly true for vaccine antigens of the A(H3N2) influenza virus subtype, where continual antigenic drift necessitates frequent vaccine reformulation. Broadly-reactive influenza virus vaccine antigens offer a solution to combat antigenic drift, but they also need to be equally effective in all populations, regardless of prior influenza virus exposure history. This study examined the role that pre-existing immunity plays on influenza virus vaccination. Ferrets were infected with historical A(H3N2) influenza viruses isolated from either the 1970's, 1980's, or 1990's and then vaccinated with computationally optimized broadly reactive antigens (COBRA) or wild-type (WT) influenza virus like particles (VLPs) expressing hemagglutinin (HA) vaccine antigens to examine the expansion of immune breadth. Vaccines with the H3 COBRA HA antigens had more cross-reactive antibodies following a single vaccination in all three pre-immune regimens than vaccines with WT H3 HA antigens against historical, contemporary, and future drifted A(H3N2) influenza viruses. The H3 COBRA HA vaccines also induced antibodies capable of neutralizing live virus infections against modern drifted A(H3N2) strains at higher titers than the WT H3 HA vaccine comparators.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The ease at which influenza virus sequence data can be used to estimate antigenic relationships between strains and the existence of databases containing sequence data for hundreds of thousands influenza strains make sequence-based antigenic distance estimates an attractive approach to researchers. Antigenic mismatch between circulating strains and vaccine strains results in significantly decreased vaccine effectiveness. Furthermore, antigenic relatedness between the vaccine strain and the strains an individual was originally primed with can affect the cross-reactivity of the antibody response. Thus, understanding the antigenic relationships between influenza viruses that have circulated is important to both vaccinologists and immunologists. RESULTS: Here we develop a method of mapping antigenic relationships between influenza virus stains using a sequence-based antigenic distance approach (SBM). We used a modified version of the p-all-epitope sequence-based antigenic distance calculation, which determines the antigenic relatedness between strains using influenza hemagglutinin (HA) genetic coding sequence data and provide experimental validation of the p-all-epitope calculation. We calculated the antigenic distance between 4838 H1N1 viruses isolated from infected humans between 1918 and 2016. We demonstrate, for the first time, that sequence-based antigenic distances of H1N1 Influenza viruses can be accurately represented in 2-dimenstional antigenic cartography using classic multidimensional scaling. Additionally, the model correctly predicted decreases in cross-reactive antibody levels with 87\% accuracy and was highly reproducible with even when small numbers of sequences were used. CONCLUSION: This work provides a highly accurate and precise bioinformatics tool that can be used to assess immune risk as well as design optimized vaccination strategies. SBM accurately estimated the antigenic relationship between strains using HA sequence data. Antigenic maps of H1N1 virus strains reveal that strains cluster antigenically similar to what has been reported for H3N2 viruses. Furthermore, we demonstrated that genetic variation differs across antigenic sites and discuss the implications.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Understanding antigenic evolution through cross-reactivity assays is crucial for tracking viral pathogens and informing vaccine development, particularly for rapidly evolving pathogens requiring regular vaccine updates. However, existing cartography methods, commonly based on multidimensional scaling (MDS), face significant challenges with sparse data, producing incomplete and inconsistent maps. There is an urgent need for robust computational methods that can accurately map antigenic relationships from incomplete experimental data while maintaining biological relevance, especially given that up to 95\% of possible measurements may be missing in large-scale studies. Results: We present Topolow, a physics-inspired optimization framework that transforms crossreactivity and binding affinity measurements into accurate positions in a phenotype space. By modeling antigenic relationships as a system of particles connected by springs representing measured similarities, with selective repulsion between unmeasured pairs, Topolow achieves superior performance compared to MDS. Applied to neutralization data for H3N2 influenza and HIV viruses, our method demonstrated 12\% and 43\% improvement in prediction accuracy respectively, while maintaining complete positioning of all antigens. Topolow determines optimal dimensionality through likelihood-based estimation, avoiding distortions due to insufficient dimensions, and demonstrates orders of magnitude better stability across multiple runs. The method effectively reduces experimental noise and bias, revealing the underlying antigenic relationships and clusters.},

  abstract = {Studies of successive vaccination suggest that immunological memory against past influenza viruses may limit responses to vaccines containing current strains. The impact of memory induced by prior infection is rarely considered and is difficult to ascertain, because infections are often subclinical. This study investigated influenza vaccination among adults from the Ha Nam cohort (Vietnam), who were purposefully selected to include 72 with and 28 without documented influenza A(H3N2) infection during the preceding 9 years (Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry 12621000110886). The primary outcome was the effect of prior influenza A(H3N2) infection on hemagglutinin-inhibiting antibody responses induced by a locally available influenza vaccine administered in November 2016. Baseline and postvaccination sera were titrated against 40 influenza A(H3N2) strains spanning 1968-2018. At each time point (baseline, day 14 and day 280), geometric mean antibody titers against 2008-2018 strains were higher among participants with recent infection (34 (29-40), 187 (154-227) and 86 (72-103)) than among participants without recent infection (19 (17-22), 91 (64-130) and 38 (30-49)). On days 14 and 280, mean titer rises against 2014-2018 strains were 6.1-fold (5.0- to 7.4-fold) and 2.6-fold (2.2- to 3.1-fold) for participants with recent infection versus 4.8-fold (3.5- to 6.7-fold) and 1.9-fold (1.5- to 2.3-fold) for those without. One of 72 vaccinees with recent infection versus 4 of 28 without developed symptomatic A(H3N2) infection in the season after vaccination (P\,=\,0.021). The range of A(H3N2) viruses recognized by vaccine-induced antibodies was associated with the prior infection strain. These results suggest that recall of immunological memory induced by prior infection enhances antibody responses to inactivated influenza vaccine and is important to attain protective antibody titers.},

Antigenic phenotype is often assessed through pairwise measurement of cross-reactivity between influenza strains using the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay. Here, we extend previous approaches to antigenic cartography, and simultaneously characterize antigenic and genetic evolution by modeling the diffusion of antigenic phenotype over a shared virus phylogeny. Using HI data from influenza lineages A/H3N2, A/H1N1, B/Victoria and B/Yamagata, we determine patterns of antigenic drift across viral lineages, showing that A/H3N2 evolves faster and in a more punctuated fashion than other influenza lineages. We also show that year-to-year antigenic drift appears to drive incidence patterns within each influenza lineage. This work makes possible substantial future advances in investigating the dynamics of influenza and other antigenically-variable pathogens by providing a model that intimately combines molecular and antigenic evolution.

Here we show that computationally designed, two-component nanoparticle immunogens2 induce potently neutralizing and broadly protective antibody responses against a wide variety of influenza viruses. The nanoparticle immunogens contain 20 haemagglutinin glycoprotein trimers in an ordered array, and their assembly in vitro enables the precisely controlled co-display of multiple distinct haemagglutinin proteins in defined ratios. Nanoparticle immunogens that co-display the four haemagglutinins of licensed quadrivalent influenza vaccines elicited antibody responses in several animal models against vaccine-matched strains that were equivalent to or better than commercial quadrivalent influenza vaccines, and simultaneously induced broadly protective antibody responses to heterologous viruses by targeting the subdominant yet conserved haemagglutinin stem. The combination of potent receptor-blocking and cross-reactive stem-directed antibodies induced by the nanoparticle immunogens makes them attractive candidates for a supraseasonal influenza vaccine candidate with the potential to replace conventional seasonal vaccines3.},

Vaccine effectiveness varies from season to season as a result of both host immune responses as well as evolutionary changes in the influenza virus surface glycoproteins that provide challenges to vaccine manufacturers to produce more effective annual vaccines. Next generation influenza vaccines are in development and may provide protective immune responses against a broader number of influenza viruses and reduce the need for annual vaccination. An improved understanding how current influenza vaccines are influenced by human host immune responses in people of different ages and co-morbidities is necessary for designing the next-generation of 'universal' or broadly-protective influenza vaccines. Overall, pre-existing immune responses to previous influenza virus exposures, either by past infections or vaccinations, is a critical factor influencing host responses to seasonal influenza vaccination. Participants vaccinated in consecutive seasons had reduced serum hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) activity against strains included in the vaccine compared to participants that had not been vaccinated in the preceding 1--2 years prior to entering this study. The magnitude and breadth of these antibody responses were also modulated by the age of the participant. Elderly participants over 65 years of age, in general, had lower pre-existing HAI titers each season prior to vaccination with lower post-vaccination titers compared to children or young adults under the age of 35. The administration of higher doses (HD) of the split-inactivated vaccine enhanced the antibody titers in the elderly. This report showcases 6 consecutive years of antibody HAI activity in human subjects receiving seasonal split-inactivated influenza vaccine.},

Despite these updates, the effectiveness of influenza vaccines against H3N2-associated disease is suboptimal. Seasonal influenza vaccines primarily induce hemagglutinin-specific antibody responses. However, antibodies directed against influenza neuraminidase (NA) also contribute to protection. Here, we analysed the antigenic diversity of a panel of N2 NAs derived from human H3N2 viruses that circulated between 2009 and 2017. The antigenic breadth of these NAs was determined based on the NA inhibition (NAI) of a broad panel of ferret and mouse immune sera that were raised by infection and recombinant N2 NA immunisation. This assessment allowed us to distinguish at least four antigenic groups in the N2 NAs derived from human H3N2 viruses that circulated between 2009 and 2017. Computational analysis further revealed that the amino acid residues in N2 NA that have a major impact on susceptibility to NAI by immune sera are in proximity of the catalytic site. Finally, a machine learning method was developed that allowed to accurately predict the impact of mutations that are present in our N2 NA panel on NAI. These findings have important implications for the renewed interest to develop improved influenza vaccines based on the inclusion of a protective NA antigen formulation.},

Source data were derived from a systematic literature review that identified 15 studies, representing a total of 5899 adult subjects and 1304 influenza cases with interval-censored information on HI titre. The parameters of the relationship between HI titre and clinical protection were estimated using Bayesian inference with a consideration of random effects and censorship in the available information.A significant and positive relationship between HI titre and clinical protection against influenza was observed in all tested models. This relationship was found to be similar irrespective of the type of viral strain (A or B) and the vaccination status of the individuals.Although limitations in the data used should not be overlooked, the relationship derived in this analysis provides a means to predict the efficacy of inactivated influenza vaccines when only immunogenicity data are available. This relationship can also be useful for comparing the efficacy of different influenza vaccines based on their immunological profile.},

  abstract = {The recent emergence of H1N1 (swine flu) illustrates the ability of the influenza virus to create antigens new to the human immune system, even within a given hemagglutinin and neuraminidase subtype. This new H1N1 strain is sufficiently distinct, for example, from the A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1)-like virus strain of influenza in the 2008/09 Northern hemisphere vaccine that protection is not expected to be substantial. The human immune system responds primarily to the five epitope regions of the hemagglutinin protein. By determining the fraction of amino acids that differ between a vaccine strain and a viral challenge strain in the dominant epitope regions, a measure of antigenic distance that correlates with epidemiological studies of H3 influenza A vaccine efficacy in humans with R2 = 0.81 is derived. This measure of antigenic distance is called pepitope. The relation between vaccine efficacy and pepitope is given by E = 0.47 -- 2.47 {\texttimes} pepitope. We here identify the epitope regions of H1 hemagglutinin, so that vaccine efficacy may be reliably estimated for H1N1 influenza A.},

  abstract = {Humans are repeatedly exposed to variants of influenza virus throughout their lifetime. As a result, preexisting influenza-specific memory B cells can dominate the response after infection or vaccination. Memory B cells recalled by adulthood exposure are largely reactive to conserved viral epitopes present in childhood strains, posing unclear consequences on the ability of B cells to adapt to and neutralize newly emerged strains. We sought to investigate the impact of preexisting immunity on generation of protective antibody responses to conserved viral epitopes upon influenza virus infection and vaccination in humans. We accomplished this by characterizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from plasmablasts, which are predominantly derived from preexisting memory B cells. We found that, whereas some influenza infection-induced mAbs bound conserved and neutralizing epitopes on the hemagglutinin (HA) stalk domain or neuraminidase, most of the mAbs elicited by infection targeted non-neutralizing epitopes on nucleoprotein and other unknown antigens. Furthermore, most infection-induced mAbs had equal or stronger affinity to childhood strains, indicating recall of memory B cells from childhood exposures. Vaccination-induced mAbs were similarly induced from past exposures and exhibited substantial breadth of viral binding, although, in contrast to infection-induced mAbs, they targeted neutralizing HA head epitopes. Last, cocktails of infection-induced mAbs displayed reduced protective ability in mice compared to vaccination-induced mAbs. These findings reveal that both preexisting immunity and exposure type shape protective antibody responses to conserved influenza virus epitopes in humans. Natural infection largely recalls cross-reactive memory B cells against non-neutralizing epitopes, whereas vaccination harnesses preexisting immunity to target protective HA epitopes.},

Given the enormous diversity of circulating virus strains and antibody responses, comprehensively testing all antibody-virus interactions is infeasible. Even within individual studies with limited panels, exhaustive testing is not always performed, and there is no common framework for combining information across studies with partially overlapping panels, especially when the assay type or host species differ. Prior studies have demonstrated that antibody-virus interactions can be characterized in a vastly simpler and lower dimensional space, suggesting that relatively few measurements could predict unmeasured antibody-virus interactions. Here, we apply matrix completion to several large-scale influenza and HIV-1 studies. We explore how prediction accuracy evolves as the number of measurements changes and approximates the number of additional measurements necessary in several highly incomplete datasets (suggesting {$\sim$}250,000 measurements could be saved). In addition, we show how the method can combine disparate datasets, even when the number of available measurements is below the theoretical limit that guarantees successful prediction. This approach can be readily generalized to other viruses or more broadly to other low-dimensional biological datasets.},

Although the interactions between a single antibody and a single virus are routinely characterized in exquisite detail, the inherent tradeoffs between attributes such as potency and breadth remain unclear. Moreover, there is a wide gap between the discrete interactions of single antibodies and the collective behavior of antibody mixtures. Here we develop a form of antigenic cartography called a `neutralization landscape' that visualizes and quantifies antibody--virus interactions for antibodies targeting the influenza hemagglutinin stem. This landscape transforms the potency--breadth tradeoff into a readily solvable geometry problem. With it, we decompose the collective neutralization from multiple antibodies to characterize the composition and functional properties of the stem antibodies within. Looking forward, this framework can leverage the serological assays routinely performed for influenza surveillance to analyze how an individual's antibody repertoire evolves after vaccination or infection.},

Upon infection and vaccination, titers increased broadly, including previously encountered viruses far beyond the extent of cross-reactivity observed after a primary infection. We explored implications for vaccination and found that the use of an antigenically advanced virus had the dual benefit of inducing antibodies against both advanced and previous antigenic clusters.

  abstract = {Evaluation of the antigenic similarity degree between the strains of the influenza virus is highly important for vaccine production. The conventional method used to measure such a degree is related to performing the immunological assays of hemagglutinin inhibition. Namely, the antigenic distance between two strains is calculated on the basis of HI assays. Usually, such distances are visualized by using some kind of antigenic cartography method. The known drawback of the HI assay is that it is rather time-consuming and expensive. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for antigenic distance approximation based on deep learning in the feature spaces induced by hemagglutinin protein sequences and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). To apply a CNN to compare the protein sequences, we utilize the encoding based on the physical and chemical characteristics of amino acids. By varying (hyper)parameters of the CNN architecture design, we find the most robust network. Further, we provide insight into the relationship between approximated antigenic distance and antigenicity by evaluating the network on the HI assay database for the H1N1 subtype. The results indicate that the best-trained network gives a high-precision approximation for the ground-truth antigenic distances, and can be used as a good exploratory tool in practical tasks.},

Probabilistic programming languages make it easier to specify and fit Bayesian models, but this still leaves us with many options regarding constructing, evaluating, and using these models, along with many remaining challenges in computation. Using Bayesian inference to solve real-world problems requires not only statistical skills, subject matter knowledge, and programming, but also awareness of the decisions made in the process of data analysis. All of these aspects can be understood as part of a tangled workflow of applied Bayesian statistics. Beyond inference, the workflow also includes iterative model building, model checking, validation and troubleshooting of computational problems, model understanding, and model comparison. We review all these aspects of workflow in the context of several examples, keeping in mind that in practice we will be fitting many models for any given problem, even if only a subset of them will ultimately be relevant for our conclusions.},

This problem of ``doing things right'' on a large scale is not essentially new; in a telephone central office, for example, a very large number of operations are performed while the errors leading to wrong numbers are kept well under control, though they have not been completely eliminated. This has been achieved, in part, through the use of self-checking circuits. The occasional failure that escapes routine checking is still detected by the customer and will, if it persists, result in customer complaint, while if it is transient it will produce only occasional wrong numbers. At the same time the rest of the central office functions satisfactorily. In a digital computer, on the other hand, a single failure usually means the complete failure, in the sense that if it is detected no more computing can be done until the failure is located and corrected, while if it escapes detection then it invalidates all subsequent operations of the machine. Put in other words, in a telephone central office there are a number of parallel paths which are more or less independent of each other; in a digital machine there is usually a single long path which passes through the same piece of equipment many, many times before the answer is obtained.},

  abstract = {The strength and breadth of an individual's antibody repertoire is an important predictor of their response to influenza infection or vaccination. Although progress has been made in understanding qualitatively how repeated exposures shape the antibody mediated immune response, quantitative understanding remains limited. We developed a set of mathematical models describing short-term antibody kinetics following influenza infection or vaccination and fit them to haemagglutination inhibition (HI) titres from 5 groups of ferrets which were exposed to different combinations of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV with or without adjuvant), A/H3N2 priming inoculation and post-vaccination A/H1N1 inoculation. We fit models with various immunological mechanisms that have been empirically observed but have not previously been included in mathematical models of antibody landscapes, including: titre ceiling effects, antigenic seniority and exposure-type specific cross reactivity. Based on the parameter estimates of the best supported models, we describe a number of key immunological features. We found quantifiable differences in the degree of homologous and cross-reactive antibody boosting elicited by different exposure types. Infection and adjuvanted vaccination generally resulted in strong, broadly reactive responses whereas unadjuvanted vaccination resulted in a weak, narrow response. We found that the order of exposure mattered: priming with A/H3N2 improved subsequent vaccine response, and the second dose of adjuvanted vaccination resulted in substantially greater antibody boosting than the first. Either antigenic seniority or a titre ceiling effect were included in the two best fitting models, suggesting a role for a mechanism describing diminishing antibody boosting with repeated exposures. Although there was considerable uncertainty in our estimates of antibody waning parameters, our results suggest that both short and long term waning were present and would be identifiable with a larger set of experiments. These results highlight the potential use of repeat exposure animal models in revealing short-term, strain-specific immune dynamics of influenza., Despite most individuals having some preexisting immunity from past influenza infections and vaccinations, a significant proportion of the human population is infected with influenza each year. Predicting how an individual's antibody profile will change following exposure is therefore useful for evaluating which populations are at greatest risk and how effective vaccination strategies might be. However, interpretation of antibody data from humans is complicated by immunological interactions between all previous, unobserved exposures in an individual's life. We developed a mathematical model to describe short-term antibody kinetics that are important in building an individual's immune profile but are difficult to observe in human populations. We validated this model using antibody data from ferrets with known, varied infection and vaccination histories. We were able to quantify the independent contributions of various exposures and immunological mechanisms in generating observed antibody titres. These results suggest that data from experimental systems may be included in models of human antibody dynamics, which may improve predictions of vaccination strategy effectiveness and how population susceptibility changes over time.},

Analyzing a panel of monoclonal antibody hemagglutinin escape mutants revealed a positive correlation between receptor binding avidity and escape from polyclonal antibodies. We propose that in response to variation in neutralizing antibody pressure between individuals, influenza A virus evolves by adjusting receptor binding avidity via amino acid substitutions throughout the hemagglutinin globular domain, many of which simultaneously alter antigenicity.},

Ironically, although thousands of viral isolates are sequenced each year, today's influenza surveillance community places less emphasis on viral genetic information and more emphasis on classical serological assays when choosing vaccine strains. Here, I argue that these classical serological assays are oversimplified and that they fail to detect influenza mutations that facilitate escape of particular types of human antibodies. I propose that influenza vaccine strains should be updated more frequently even when classical serological assays fail to detect significant antigenic alterations.},

  abstract = {Low-rank matrix completion has been demonstrated to be powerful in predicting antigenic distances among influenza viruses and vaccines from partially revealed hemagglutination inhibition table. Meanwhile, influenza hemagglutinin (HA) protein sequences are also effective in inferring antigenic distances. Thus, it is natural to integrate HA protein sequence information into low-rank matrix completion model to help infer influenza antigenicity, which is critical to influenza vaccine development.We have proposed a novel algorithm called biological matrix completion with side information (BMCSI), which first measures HA protein sequence similarities among influenza viruses (especially on epitopes) and then integrates the similarity information into a low-rank matrix completion model to predict influenza antigenicity. This algorithm exploits both the correlations among viruses and vaccines in serological tests and the power of HA sequence in predicting influenza antigenicity. We applied this model into H3N2 seasonal influenza virus data. Comparing to previous methods, we significantly reduced the prediction root-mean-square error in a 10-fold cross validation analysis. Based on the cartographies constructed from imputed data, we showed that the antigenic evolution of H3N2 seasonal influenza is generally S-shaped while the genetic evolution is half-circle shaped. We also showed that the Spearman correlation between genetic and antigenic distances (among antigenic clusters) is 0.83, demonstrating a globally high correspondence and some local discrepancies between influenza genetic and antigenic evolution. Finally, we showed that 4.4\%{\textpm}1.2\% genetic variance (corresponding to 3.11\,{\textpm}\,1.08 antigenic distances) caused an antigenic drift event for H3N2 influenza viruses historically.The software and data for this study are available at http://bi.sky.zstu.edu.cn/BMCSI/.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

The purpose of this study was to investigate the antigenic differences of major H7 strains with an ultimate aim to discover H7 HA proteins that can elicit protective receptor-binding antibodies against co-circulating H7 influenza strains. METHOD: A panel of eight H7 influenza strains were selected from 3,633 H7 HA amino acid sequences identified over the past two decades (2000-2018). The sequences were expressed on the surface of virus like particles (VLPs) and used to vaccinate C57BL/6 mice. Serum samples were collected and tested for hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) activity. The vaccinated mice were challenged with lethal dose of H7N9 virus, A/Anhui/1/2013. RESULTS: VLPs expressing the H7 HA antigens elicited broadly reactive antibodies each of the selected H7 HAs, except the A/Turkey/Italy/589/2000 (Italy/00) H7 HA. A putative glycosylation due to an A169T substitution in antigenic site B was identified as a unique antigenic profile of Italy/00. Introduction of the putative glycosylation site (H7 HA-A169T) significantly altered the antigenic profile of HA of the A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) strain. CONCLUSION: This study identified key amino acid mutations that result in severe vaccine mismatches for future H7 epidemics. Future universal influenza vaccine candidates will need to focus on viral variants with these key mutations.},

  abstract = {Numerous modern technological and scientific advances have changed the vaccine industry. However, nearly 70 years of influenza vaccine usage have passed without substantial changes in the underlying principles of the vaccine. The challenge of vaccinating against influenza lies in the constantly changing nature of the virus itself. Influenza viruses undergo antigenic evolution through antigenic drift and shift in their surface glycoproteins. This has forced frequent updates of vaccine antigens to ensure that the somewhat narrowly focused vaccine-induced immune responses defend against circulating strains. Few vaccine production systems have been developed that can entertain such constant changes. Although influenza virus infection induces long-lived immunologic memory to the same or similar strains, most people do not encounter the same strain repeatedly in their lifespan, suggesting that enhancement of natural immunity is required to improve influenza vaccines. It is clear that transformative change of influenza vaccines requires a rethink of how we immunize. In this study, we review the problems associated with the changing nature of the virus, and highlight some of the approaches being employed to improve influenza vaccines.},

By introducing an epidemiological model that allows for differences between the genetic and antigenic properties of the virus's hemagglutinin, we show that these patterns can arise from cluster-specific immunity alone. Central to the formulation is a genotype-to-phenotype mapping, based on neutral networks, with antigenic phenotypes, not genotypes, determining the degree of strain cross-immunity. The model parsimoniously explains well-known, as well as previously unremarked, features of interpandemic influenza dynamics and evolution. It captures the observed boom-and-bust pattern of viral evolution, with periods of antigenic stasis during which genetic diversity grows, and with episodic contraction of this diversity during cluster transitions.},

  abstract = {Influenza is an infectious respiratory disease that, in humans, is caused by influenza A and influenza B viruses. Typically characterized by annual seasonal epidemics, sporadic pandemic outbreaks involve influenza A virus strains of zoonotic origin. The WHO estimates that annual epidemics of influenza result in {\textasciitilde}1 billion infections, 3--5 million cases of severe illness and 300,000--500,000 deaths. The severity of pandemic influenza depends on multiple factors, including the virulence of the pandemic virus strain and the level of pre-existing immunity. The most severe influenza pandemic, in 1918, resulted in\,{$>$}40 million deaths worldwide. Influenza vaccines are formulated every year to match the circulating strains, as they evolve antigenically owing to antigenic drift. Nevertheless, vaccine efficacy is not optimal and is dramatically low in the case of an antigenic mismatch between the vaccine and the circulating virus strain. Antiviral agents that target the influenza virus enzyme neuraminidase have been developed for prophylaxis and therapy. However, the use of these antivirals is still limited. Emerging approaches to combat influenza include the development of universal influenza virus vaccines that provide protection against antigenically distant influenza viruses, but these vaccines need to be tested in clinical trials to ascertain their effectiveness.},

  abstract = {Human immunity influences the evolution and impact of influenza strains. Because individuals are infected with multiple influenza strains during their lifetime, and each virus can generate a cross-reactive antibody response, it is challenging to quantify the processes that shape observed immune responses or to reliably detect recent infection from serological samples. Using a Bayesian model of antibody dynamics at multiple timescales, we explain complex cross-reactive antibody landscapes by inferring participants' histories of infection with serological data from cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of influenza A/H3N2 in southern China and Vietnam. We find that individual-level influenza antibody profiles can be explained by a short-lived, broadly cross-reactive response that decays within a year to leave a smaller long-term response acting against a narrower range of strains. We also demonstrate that accounting for dynamic immune responses alongside infection history can provide a more accurate alternative to traditional definitions of seroconversion for the estimation of infection attack rates. Our work provides a general model for quantifying aspects of influenza immunity acting at multiple timescales based on contemporary serological data and suggests a two-armed immune response to influenza infection consistent with competitive dynamics between B cell populations. This approach to analysing multiple timescales for antigenic responses could also be applied to other multistrain pathogens such as dengue and related flaviviruses.},

In this study, volunteers (ages of 18--85 years) were vaccinated with split, inactivated Fluzone™ influenza vaccine in four consecutive influenza seasons from 2013 to 2016 seasons. The impact of repeated vaccination on breadth and durability of antibodies was assessed as a result of vaccine strain changes. Total IgG anti-hemagglutinin (HA) binding antibodies and hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) activity increased in all age groups against both influenza A HA components in the vaccine post-vaccination (day 21). However, younger subjects maintained seroprotective titers to the vaccine strains, which resulted in higher seroconversion rates in the elderly, since the HAI titers in elderly subjects were more likely to decline prior to the next season. Young subjects had significant HAI activity against historical, as well as contemporary H1 and H3 vaccine strains from the mid-1980s to present. In contrast, elderly subjects had HAI activity to H1 strains from all years, but were more likely to have HAI activity to older strains from 1918-1950s. They also had a more restricted HAI profile against H3 viruses compared to young subjects recognizing H3N2 influenza viruses from the mid-2000s to present. Vaccine recipients were then categorized by whether subjects seroconverted from a seronegative or seropositive pre-vaccination state. Regardless of age, immunological recall or `back-boosting' to antigenically related strains were associated with seroconversion to the vaccine strain. Overall, both younger and older people have the ability to mount a breadth of immune responses following influenza vaccination. This report describes how imprinting exposure differs across age groups, influences antibody cross-reactivity to past hemagglutinin antigenic variants, and shapes immune responses elicited by current split inactivated influenza vaccines. Understanding how current influenza vaccines are influenced by pre-existing immunity in people of different ages is critical for designing the next-generation of `universal' or broadly-protective influenza vaccines.},

In many recent examples, differences in early infection history can explain birth year-associated differences in susceptibility (cohort effects). Susceptibility shapes strain fitness, but without a clear conceptual model linking host susceptibility to the identity and order of past infections, general conclusions on the evolutionary and epidemic implications of cohort effects are not possible. Failure to differentiate between cohort effects caused by differences in the set, rather than the order (path), of past infections is a current source of confusion. We review and refine hypotheses for path-dependent cohort effects, which include imprinting. We highlight strategies to measure their underlying causes and emergent consequences.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Influenza vaccines are an essential tool for influenza prevention, control and preparedness. However, demand for them and their programmatic suitability globally is significantly influenced by their variable effectiveness against influenza illness annually, limited duration of protection and need for yearly updating and vaccination. As such, the World Health Organization and major funders, such as the United States National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, have strongly encouraged developing influenza vaccines with increased efficacy, breadth and duration of protection. Here, we review the next-generation influenza vaccine pipeline, focusing on products in clinical development, and compare their characteristics to currently approved seasonal influenza vaccines. METHODS: To identify and characterize next-generation influenza vaccine candidates, we conducted a comprehensive literature review, using the CIDRAP Universal Influenza Vaccine Technology Landscape as a primary reference source and extracting additional information from peer-reviewed manuscripts, clinical trial records and other media in the public domain. RESULTS: Our analysis reveals a robust clinical development pipeline for next-generation influenza vaccines, featuring a diversity of approaches to address existing vaccine challenges and several candidates in advanced stages of development. mRNA vaccines emerged as a predominant platform, as evidenced by the number of candidates focused on improved seasonal protection as well as combination vaccine candidates targeting additional respiratory viruses. CONCLUSION: While still early in development, results from universal or broadly protective products are promising and warrant continued investment from funders. As most Phase 3 candidates are mRNA-based and include combination vaccines, it is critical to begin considering how these new products may become integrated into the current global influenza vaccine strain selection and manufacturing ecosystems, and existing immunization programmes.},

  abstract = {Influenza virus is a respiratory pathogen that can cause disease in humans, with symptoms ranging from mild to life-threatening. The vast majority of influenza virus infections in humans are observed during seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemics. Given the substantial public health burden associated with influenza virus infection, yearly vaccination is recommended for protection against seasonal influenza viruses. Despite vigilant surveillance for new variants and careful selection of seasonal vaccine strains, the efficacy of seasonal vaccines can vary widely from year to year. This often results in lowered protection within the population, regardless of vaccination status. In order to broaden the protection afforded by seasonal influenza vaccines, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has deemed the development of a universal influenza virus vaccine to be a priority in influenza virus vaccine research. This universal vaccine would provide protection against all influenza virus strains, eliminating the need for the yearly reformulations of seasonal influenza vaccines. In addition to universal influenza vaccine efforts, substantial progress has been made in developing novel influenza virus therapeutics that utilize broadly neutralizing antibodies to provide protection against influenza virus infection and to mitigate disease outcomes during infection. In this review, we discuss various approaches toward the goal of improving influenza virus vaccine efficacy through a universal influenza virus vaccine. We also address the novel methods of discovery and utilization of broadly neutralizing antibodies to improve influenza disease outcomes.},

Improved reproducibility of this assay is required to provide meaningful data across different testing laboratories. This study assessed the impact of harmonizing the HAI assay protocol/reagents and using standards on interlaboratory variability. Human pre- and postvaccination sera from individuals (n\,=\,30) vaccinated against influenza were tested across six laboratories. We used a design of experiment (DOE) method to evaluate the impact of assay parameters on interlaboratory HAI assay variability. Statistical and mathematical approaches were used for data analysis. We developed a consensus protocol and assessed its performance against in-house HAI testing. We additionally tested the performance of several potential biological standards. In-house testing with four reassortant viruses showed considerable interlaboratory variation (geometric coefficient of variation [GCV] range of 50\% to 117\%). The age, concentration of turkey red blood cells, incubation duration, and temperature were key assay parameters affecting variability. Use of a consensus protocol with common reagents, including viruses, significantly reduced GCV between laboratories to 22\% to 54\%. Pooled postvaccination human sera from different vaccination campaigns were effective as biological standards. Our results demonstrate that the harmonization of protocols and critical reagents is effective in reducing interlaboratory variability in HAI assay results and that pools of postvaccination human sera have potential as biological standards that can be used over multiple vaccination campaigns. Moreover, the use of standards together with in-house protocols is as potent as the use of common protocols and reagents in reducing interlaboratory variability. IMPORTANCE The hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay is the most commonly used serology assay to detect antibodies from influenza vaccination or influenza virus infection. This assay has been used for decades but requires improved standardization of procedures to provide meaningful data. We designed a large study to assess selected parameters for their contribution to assay variability and developed a standard protocol to promote consistent HAI testing methods across laboratories. The use of this protocol and common reagents resulted in lower levels of variability in results between participating laboratories than achieved using in-house HAI testing. Human sera sourced from vaccination campaigns over several years, and thus including antibody to different influenza vaccine strains, served as effective assay standards. Based on our findings, we recommend the use of a common protocol and/or human serum standards, if available, for testing human sera for the presence of antibodies against seasonal influenza using turkey red blood cells.},

Primary analytic methods, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent/lectin assays, hemagglutination inhibition, neuraminidase inhibition, micro-neutralization assays, and antigenic cartography, have been widely used in the field of influenza research. These techniques have been improved upon over time for increased analytical capacity, and some have been mobilized for the rapid characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 virus as well as its variants, facilitating the development of highly effective vaccines within 1 year of the initially reported outbreak. While great strides have been made for evaluating the antigenic properties of these viruses, multiple challenges prevent efficient vaccine strain selection and accurate assessment. For influenza, these barriers include the requirement for a large virus quantity to perform the assays, more than what can typically be provided by the clinical samples alone, cell- or egg-adapted mutations that can cause antigenic mismatch between the vaccine strain and circulating viruses, and up to a 6-month duration of vaccine development after vaccine strain selection, which allows viruses to continue evolving with potential for antigenic drift and, thus, antigenic mismatch between the vaccine strain and the emerging epidemic strain. SARS-CoV-2 characterization has faced similar challenges with the additional barrier of the need for facilities with high biosafety levels due to its infectious nature. In this study, we review the primary analytic methods used for antigenic characterization of influenza and SARS-CoV-2 and discuss the barriers of these methods and current developments for addressing these challenges.},

Antibody profiles can be generated by characterizing immune responses to multiple antigenically variant strains, but how these profiles vary across individuals and determine future responses is unclear. We used hemagglutination inhibition titers from 21 H3N2 strains to construct 777 paired antibody profiles from people aged 2 to 86, and developed novel metrics to capture features of these profiles. Total antibody titer per potential influenza exposure increases in early life, then decreases in middle age. Increased titers to one or more strains were seen in 97.8\% of participants during a roughly four-year interval, suggesting widespread influenza exposure. While titer changes were seen to all strains, recently circulating strains exhibited the greatest titer rise. Higher pre-existing, homologous titers at baseline reduced the risk of seroconversion to recent strains. After adjusting for homologous titer, we also found an increased frequency of seroconversion against recent strains among those with higher immunity to older previously exposed strains. Including immunity to previously exposures also improved the deviance explained by the models. Our results suggest that a comprehensive quantitative description of immunity encompassing past exposures could lead to improved correlates of risk of influenza infection.},

In this study, we standardized HAI assay materials, methods, and interpretive criteria across five geographically dispersed laboratories of a multidisciplinary influenza research network and then evaluated intralaboratory and interlaboratory variations in HAI titers by repeatedly testing standardized panels of human serum samples. Duplicate precision and reproducibility from comparisons between assays within laboratories were 99.8\% (99.2\% to 100\%) and 98.0\% (93.3\% to 100\%), respectively. The results for 98.9\% (95\% to 100\%) of the samples were within 2-fold of all-laboratory consensus titers, and the results for 94.3\% (85\% to 100\%) of the samples were within 2-fold of our reference laboratory data. Low-titer samples showed the greatest variability in comparisons between assays and between sites. Classification of seroprotection (titer {$\geq$} 40) was accurate in 93.6\% or 89.5\% of cases in comparison to the consensus or reference laboratory classification, respectively. This study showed that with carefully chosen standardization processes, high reproducibility of HAI results between laboratories is indeed achievable.},

A major open question is why the virus population is globally dominated by a single and very recently diverged (2--8 years) lineage. Classically, this has been modeled by limiting the generation of new successful antigenic variants, such that only a small subset of progeny acquire the necessary mutations to evade host immunity. An alternative approach was recently suggested by Recker et al. in which a limited number of antigenic variants are continuously generated, but most of these are suppressed by pre-existing host population immunity. Here we develop a framework spanning the regimes described above to explore the impact of rates of mutation and levels of competition on phylodynamic patterns. We find that the evolutionary dynamics of the subtype H3N2 influenza is most easily generated within this framework when it is mutation limited as well as being under strong immune selection at a number of epitope regions of limited diversity.},
