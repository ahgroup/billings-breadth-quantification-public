BQ could be substantially sped up if we narrow our dataset focus.
E.g. only do the BQ stuff for two seasons/vaccine strains, and then use a cross-comparison to show how we would use the AUC to choose a vaccine candidate.
Only do fits with censoring, don’t focus on censoring methodological issues in this paper except in supplement. It appears to not be the main driver of the results and I think “does the censoring correction help in HAI modeling” is a good paper to write since Zelner never published his. Maybe Murphy is interested in writing this.
We can leave exploring the different distance metrics, etc. to my Aim 3 paper, and potentially use the AUC of the titer vs. distance curve (titers conditional on other confounding effects) as a descriptive statistic.
Also show in BQ paper how we can look at variance explained by antigenic distance vs. individual effects.
