# Data

This subdirectory contains all of the raw and processed data files used for
this project.

## `raw`

This folder contains data we received directly from another source and has not
been cleaned yet.

* `accession_no.xlsx`
* `data.rds`
* `fonville_jiv367supp_tables.xlsx`
* `vaccines.rds`

## `processed`

This folder contains data that has been cleaned by us and is ready for
analysis.

* List files here -- I think some need to be moved to results.

## `cluster`

* `input`: these data have been cleaned and are prepared to be sent to the
computing cluster.
* `output`: these files are returned from the cluster.
